 	<h2> korean language </h2>
 	<p id="korean">  Korean (South Korean: 한국어/韓國語, hangugeo, North Korean: 조선말/朝鮮말, chosŏnmal) is an East Asian language spoken by about 77 million people. It is the official and national language of both Koreas: North Korea and South Korea, with different standardized official forms used in each country. It is a recognised minority language in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin Province, China. It is also spoken in parts of Sakhalin, Russia and Central Asia.[3][4]

Historical and modern linguists classify Korean as a language isolate;[5][6][7] however, it does have a few extinct relatives, which together with Korean itself and the Jeju language (spoken in the Jeju Province and considered somewhat distinct) form the Koreanic language family. The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in Manchuria.</p>

 	<p> Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
Like I'm drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable
I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
(If I had a diamond… </p>
