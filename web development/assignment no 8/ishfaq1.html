   		<h1 style=" color:red"> Rumi s Quotes To Remember </h1>

   		<h2 style=" color: green"> 1. Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. </h2>

      <br>

<p>  What is javascript ? 
	<br> <br> 
	<em>
	JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

	JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.

	Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser. </em>

	 <p> <em> Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
  throughput, and low altitude service. The
  connection topology is limited to a single
  point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
  standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
  without significant interference with each other,
  outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D
  ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
  to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers
  have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which

        <p style="background-color: cyan;"> “Look at the evils of the world around you and protect yourself
             from them. Our teachers give all the wrong messages to our youth, since they take away the natural 
             flare from the soul. Take it from me that all knowledge is useless until it is connected with your
              life, because the purpose of knowledge is nothing but to show you the splendors of yourself!”

            <p style="color: rgb(47, 196, 255);"> “The revealed and mystic literature of mankind bears ample testimony to the fact that religious
                experience has been too enduring and dominant in the history of mankind to be rejected as mere
                 illusion. There seems to be no reason, then, to accept the normal level of human experience as
                  fact and reject its other levels as mystical and emotional.”

                    ― Muhammad Iqbal  For centuries Eastern heart and intellect have been absorbed in the question � Does God exist?
