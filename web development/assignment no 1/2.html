<h2>
The Kashmir  &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp conflict is a territorial conflict primarily between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. The conflict started after the partition of India in 1947 as a dispute over the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and escalated into three wars between India and Pakistan and several other armed skirmishes. China has also been involved in the conflict in a third-party role.[2][3] Both India and Pakistan claim the entirety of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. India controls approximately 55% of the land area of the region and 70% of its population, Pakistan controls approximately 30% of the land, while China controls the remaining 15%.[4][5][6] India administers Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and the Siachen Glacier.[7] Pakistan administers Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. China administers the mostly uninhabited Shaksgam Valley, and the Aksai Chin region.[8]

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 was fought over the accession of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir to India and resulted in a ceasefire with a front solidified along the Line of Control.[9][10] After further fighting in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Simla Agreement formally established the Line of Control between the two nations' controlled territories.[11][12] In 1999, armed conflict between India and Pakistan broke out again in the Kargil War over the Kargil district.[13]

Since 1989, Kashmiri protest movements were created to voice Kashmir's disputes and grievances with the Indian government in the Indian-controlled Kashmir Valley,[14][15] with some Kashmiri separatists in armed conflict with the Indian government based on the demand for self-determination.[16][17][18][14][15][19][20][21][22][23] The 2010s were marked by further unrest erupting within the Kashmir Valley. The 2010 Kashmir unrest began after an alleged fake encounter between local youth and security forces.[24] Thousands of youths pelted security forces with rocks, burned government offices and attacked railway stations and official vehicles in steadily intensifying violence.[25] The Indian government blamed separatists and Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group for stoking the 2010 protests.[26] The 2016 Kashmir unrest erupted after killing of a Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani by Indian security forces.[27] Further unrest in the region erupted after the 2019 Pulwama attack.[28]

According to scholars, Indian forces have committed many human rights abuses and acts of terror against Kashmiri civilian population including extrajudicial killing, rape, torture and enforced disappearances.[17][29][30] According to Amnesty International, no member of the Indian military deployed in Jammu and Kashmir has been tried for human rights violations in a civilian court as of June 2015, although there have been military court martials held.[31] Amnesty International has also accused the Indian government of refusing to prosecute perpetrators of abuses in the region

What impact has the ongoing conflict in Kashmir had upon the people of the region? Are there steps that can be taken to help resolve this longstanding dispute between India and Pakistan? On April 27, 2004 the Institute hosted a presentation by senior fellow Wajahat Habibullah on "The Kashmir Problem and Its Resolution." Drawing from his research for the project and his many years of service with the government of India in Kashmir, he described the background to the problem and identified some of the factors that continue to make resolution difficult. In particular, he discussed the economic impact of the war on life for Kashmiris and the consequences this has for fueling further conflict. He also suggested paths for moving the conflict toward settlement.

Wajahat Habibullah is on leave from his assignment as secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Consumer Affairs. His deep involvement in Kashmir affairs has included a term as vice chair and chief executive of the Jammu and Kashmir Lakes and Waterways Development Authority (Srinagar, 1999-2000), terms as divisional commissioner heading the administration of the eight districts of Kashmir Valley and Ladakh (in 1990-91 and 1993), and 15 years of service in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, where he organized the State Assembly elections in 1977. As commissioner in Kashmir during the early 1990s he repeatedly was called upon to negotiate the release of hostages taken by militants. He also conducted several major inquiries into human rights violations by Indian security forces.

Senior fellow Wajahat Habibullah began by noting that the views expressed during his talk were his own and not necessarily those of the government of India. He then gave a brief review of his research over the past year at the Institute and some background on the current situation in Kashmir.

A Closer Look at Kashmir
The problem in Kashmir, he observed, is often represented primarily as a matter between India and Pakistan and framed around the issues of the legitimacy of Kashmir's accession to India at independence. But this is not the problem today, he argued, as circumstances since the accession have changed such that the insurgency is now largely fueled by local grievances. In the current situation, the debate ought to focus on the experiences and aspirations of the people in the Kashmir valley, Habibullah pointed out.

The ethnic and religious diversity in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is divided into three regions, has contributed to the complexity of the Kashmir problem. The majority of Jammu and Kashmir's population of 5.4 million is resident in the Kashmir Valley. Their religion is 98 percent Islam with distinct Sufi characteristics. Jammu Division, on the other hand, has a population of 4.4 million, over 60 percent of whom are Hindus and 30 percent Muslims, where the latter represent a majority in three of Jammu's 6 districts. The languages are variations of Punjabi and different from Kashmiri, spoken largely in the valley. The third component, the largest of the three in area and the most remote, is Ladakh, with a population of approximately 233,000, which has a slim Muslim majority. This is mostly Shia, as distinct from the overall Sunni majority in the Kashmir Valley.

Understanding the Origins of the Insurgency
Commenting on the beginnings of the insurgency in the late 1980s, Habibullah noted that originally it was largely an ethnic issue. However, over the years the insurgency has been carefully and deliberately cultivated into a religious one. This created an environment of intolerance, intimidation, and ultimately violence throughout the valley that only exasperated other existing tensions—a situation that led to the exodus of the Kashmiri Hindu Pandits from the region. Today, Habibullah lamented, a large section of the people are either orphans or destitute, the suicide rate in the valley is high, and psychiatric services for post-traumatic stress are virtually unavailable.

Revitalizing the economy in the valley, Habibullah argued, would help address some of these problems. Describing the government's control over most of the enterprises in the region, he noted that hiring in the valley was at a virtual standstill. To address this problem, he advocated a more open private sector to provide Kashmiris with a greater stake in their future. Further, a vibrant economy overall, he noted, would remedy the crisis of high unemployment that currently afflicts Kashmir—a situation that clearly propels young Kashmiris toward insurgent movements, much as it has in many other conflict zones around the globe. However, Habibullah stressed that while an economic strategy was important to ending the insurgency, any effective comprehensive approach would need to have both an economic and political component.
