Originally known as BackRub. Google is a search engine that started development in 1996 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as a research project at Stanford University to find files on the Internet. Larry and Sergey later decided the name of their search engine needed to change and decide upon Google, which is inspired from the term googol. The company is currently based out of Mountain View, California.

The domain google.com was later registered on September 15, 1997, and the company incorporated on September 4, 1998. The picture below is a capture of the site from The Internet Archive of what Google looked like in 1998.

What helps Google stand out from its competition and helps it continue to grow and be the number one search engine is its PageRank technique that sorts search results. While being one of the best search engines on the Internet, Google also incorporates many of its other services, such as Google Maps and Google Local, to provide more relevant search results.

Google is an Internet search engine. It uses a proprietary algorithm that's designed to retrieve and order search results to provide the most relevant and dependable sources of data possible. Google's stated mission is to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." It is the No.1 search engine in the world, a position that has generated criticism and concern about the power it has to influence the flow of information on the Web.

The Google search engine is so dominant that the term Google can also be used as a verb, so that when someone searches for something on Google, they may say they "Googled" it.

<p style="color:purple;">
Windows is a collection of programs known as an operating system (OS) that controls a PC (personal computer). First produced by Microsoft in November 1985, it has been frequently updated since, as computer memory has got bigger, as processing chips have got faster and, of course, when the internet was invented. Prior to Windows, PCs were operated by a series of text commands.

Allows the user to interact with the computer (through the keyboard, mouse, microphone, etc.).
Controls the storage of data (images, files, music).
Controls hardware attached to the computer such as webcams, scanners and printers.
Helps to open and close programs (word processors, games, photo editors, etc.), and gives them part of the computer’s memory to allow them to work.
Controls what access to a computer different users have and the computer's security.
Deals with errors and user instructions, and issues simple error messages.
Promotes multitasking by allowing the user to do several things on the computer at once – for example, watch a video while writing a letter.
Other operating systems are available, notably the Apple OS X used in Mac computers. In addition, with the increased use of smartphones, notepads and tablets, there are systems aimed directly at mobile devices. However, most people who learn to use computers do so on a system running Windows.
